I searched for a Fingerprint-Script to identify any brower without the need of
Cookies. I did not really find any, so i started this Project. I'd love people
to add functions for Non-Linux-Browsers, as i have none of these Systems to
check how they work.

DESCRIPTION

  This JavaScript-Library tries to identify every Browser with a unique
  Fingerprint. To do this, it will detect different browsers and extract
  specific Informations like Plugins & Versions.
  Currently, there's not much functionality, only the UserAgent and some
  Plugin-data is used to generate the fingerprint, there's much that can be
  improoved.

USAGE

  fingerprint.str() // => 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; ...'
  fingerprint.md5() // => '6b8b43bd46578b97b656dfdc2d64b337'
